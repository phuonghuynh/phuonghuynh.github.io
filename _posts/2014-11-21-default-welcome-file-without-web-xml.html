<p>I love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" title="SPI">SPA</a> so much. And I love to do coding in this way.<br />
I used Spring Java based configuration option write most of my Spring configurations without XML but with the help of few Java-based annotations. In Servlets 3.0 you don't need a web.xml for many cases, however, sometimes it's required or just useful. This case is just one of them - there is no special annotations to define welcome-file list or error-pages. It is resolved as bellow:</p>
