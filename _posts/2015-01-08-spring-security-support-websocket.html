<p>According to article <a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/08/21/preview-spring-security-websocket-support">Preview Spring Security WebSocket Support</a>,
  Spring Security 4x now fully support Web Socket => happy <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>
<p>For people who wanna to see a complete example <a href="https://gist.github.com/phuonghuynh/857adec21c1cfd66b22a">Example Spring Security 4x support Web Socket</a></p>
<p>Caution, by default Spring Security will be failed if there is a Reverse proxy on the server. To fix this, the server need
to be configured to support Web Socket handshake. For example this is configuration of Nginx</p>
